# Simple Recipe Unlocker

This is a simple recipe unlocking datapack. This data pack unlocks ONCE per player when they first join the world, then optionally clears your inventory (You can disable it and do it and do it yourself if you'd like by recompiling the source)

## WARNING!!!

This pack removes ALL items from players when it's first loaded. This will not pose a problem in a new world or server, but make sure all player inventories are **moved into a chest** or similar if you're installing in an existing world! **You are responsible for any item loss!**

This data pack is designed to be more compatible and less intrusive than well-known alternatives.
